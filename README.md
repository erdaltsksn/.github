# Default GitHub Community Health Files

[![Codacy Security Scan](https://github.com/erdaltsksn/.github/actions/workflows/security-scan.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/erdaltsksn/.github/actions/workflows/security-scan.yml)

This project focuses on automating the creation and maintenance of crucial
community health files in GitHub repositories. These files are instrumental in
guiding contributors, maintainers, and users on best practices, project
guidelines, and code of conduct. By offering standardized templates, the project
ensures that all participating repositories possess the necessary resources to
maintain a positive and respectful environment for all stakeholders.

## üèÅ Getting Started

01. Begin your journey by forking this repository to your own GitHub account.
    Simply click on the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of this page.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è For the project to work as intended, the forked repository must be named
    precisely as `.github` with a dot (.) at the beginning and "github" in all
    lowercase letters.
02. Spice up your repository by personalizing the community health files. Tailor
    the issue templates, pull request template, and code of conduct to resonate
    with your project's spirit.
03. Create a set of engaging contributing guidelines. Encourage contributors to
    dance their fingers across the keyboard and become part of your project's
    rhythm.
04. Fortify your repository's security! Polish the security policy to ensure
    everyone can safely collaborate and share ideas without any worries.
05. If your project deserves the spotlight, don't forget to add information
    about funding sources or sponsorship options. Let the world know how they
    can help support your dreams!

## üîÑ Updating / Upgrading

GitHub offers a convenient "Sync" feature that automates the process of updating
your forked repository with the latest changes from the original repository.
Here's how you can use this feature:

01. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the forked repository named `.github`
    to sync with the upstream repository.
02. Select the Fetch upstream drop-down.
03. Review the details about the commits from the upstream repository, then
    click Fetch and merge.

*If the changes from the upstream repository cause conflicts, GitHub will prompt
you to create a pull request to resolve the conflicts.*

## üìù Usage

By default, if a repository does not contain its custom version of a particular
file, the default file provided by this project will be automatically used.

Whenever you create a new repository or want to update an existing repository
owned by your GitHub account, simply leave out the specific community health
file you wish to be automatically generated. GitHub will detect the absence of
the custom file and automatically apply the corresponding default file provided
by the `.github`` repository.

For repositories that require unique guidelines or customized community health
files, you can always override the default files by adding your tailored
versions. The custom files will take precedence over the default ones, providing
you the flexibility to cater to specific project needs.

By leveraging the Default GitHub Community Health Files project, you establish a
unified and welcoming environment for contributors across all your repositories.
