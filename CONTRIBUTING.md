This document contains a set of guidelines to help you during the contribution
process. We are happy to welcome all contributions from anyone willing to
improve this project. Thank you for helping out and remember, no contribution is
too small.

## 📋 Step By Step Contribution Guide

01. 📝 **Open an Issue**: Before you start working on any changes, open a new
    issue to discuss the problem you want to solve or the feature you want to
    add. This helps avoid duplication of efforts and ensures that your
    contribution aligns with the project's goals.
02. ⚙️ **Install Prerequisites**: Make sure you have all the necessary
    prerequisites installed to set up the project locally. Refer to the
    project's README or documentation for detailed instructions.
    This project contains a Devcontainer that includes all the necessary
    prerequisites to set up the project.
03. 🌱 **Create a Git Branch**: Create a new Git branch for your work and make
    your changes on this branch. It's good practice to name your branch
    according to the type of contribution, such as "feature/your-feature-name"
    or "bugfix/issue-number".
04. 🧪 **Add and Run Tests**: If applicable, add new tests or update existing
    ones to ensure the code's correctness and reliability. Before submitting
    your contribution, make sure all tests pass successfully.
05. 🗒️ **Add or Update Documentation**: Keep the project's documentation
    up-to-date. If you add a new feature or make significant changes, update the
    relevant documentation to help other users and contributors understand your
    work.
06. 📜 **Commit**: We follow a specific format for Git commit messages to
    maintain a clear and informative project history. Please adhere to the
    following rules:
    - Separate the subject from the body with a blank line.
    - Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
    - Capitalize the subject line.
    - Do not end the subject line with a period.
    - Use the imperative mood in the subject line.
    - Wrap the body at 72 characters.
    - Use the body to explain what and why, not how.
07. 📤 **Push and Create Pull Request**: Once your changes are ready, push your
    branch to the repository and create a pull request for review. Provide a
    clear description of your changes in the pull request, referencing the issue
    it addresses, if applicable.
08. 💬 **Communicate and Review**: Be responsive during the review process and
    engage in discussions with the maintainers. Be open to feedback and make
    necessary changes to address review comments.
09. Your contribution gets accepted. 🎉🎉🎉

> [!NOTE]
> Be sure to get the latest from "**upstream**" before making a pull request!
